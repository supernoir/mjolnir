# Mjolnir CSS
## A themeable minimal CSS framework for semantic HTML

This is not a universal CSS Framework that works for everyone. I build it because it works for me. I want to quickly implement web app ideas with minimal scaffolding. I want the framework to be easily themeable. That's all there is to it. It's my personal _Mj√∂lnir_, Thor's (in)famous War Hammer. It may have a short handle, but it is versatile.
