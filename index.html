              Professor James Moriarty is a fictional character in some of the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
              Moriarty is a criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the "Napoleon of crime ". Doyle lifted the phrase
              from a Scotland Yard inspector who was referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind and one of
              the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based.

              Mycroft Holmes is a fictional character appearing in stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He is the elder brother (by
              seven years) of detective Sherlock Holmes. He is described as having abilities of deduction and knowledge exceeding
              even those of his brother, though their practical use is limited by his poor physique and dislike of fieldwork.
